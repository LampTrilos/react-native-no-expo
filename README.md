1) To be able to use the finger scanner on T80:
   Open the T80 Hub and enable T80 HUB and T80 FP
2) For license Activation, i tested with Mutlimodal activity and placed the .sn serial files in sdcard0.Neurotechnology
   From licensing menu disable trial mode, then chose activate and pick the folder with the serial number files
   It seems that Multimodal app has created two .lic files, but for now i can't find them
3) Prior to opening the app, create this folder: sdcard/Neurotechnology/Licenses
